Part 1:

Implement a custom JSP tag as, <ct:currentDateTime>, that takes four attributes, with names given as, fontColor, fontSize dateFormat and timeFormat. The function/purpose of the tag is to render on the webpage, the current Date and Time, formatted as specified on the tag when used on a JSP page.

For Example:

JSP usage:  <ct:currentDateTime color="red" size="12px" dateFormat="E yyyy.MM.dd" timeFormat="hh:mm:ss a zzz" />

HTML output: <span style="color: red; font-size: 12px;">Mon 2016.04.04 at 04:14:09 PM PDT</span>

You may use the following code snippet:

Date dNow = new Date();
SimpleDateFormat ft = new SimpleDateFormat ("E yyyy.MM.dd 'at' hh:mm:ss a zzz");
System.out.println("Current Date: " + ft.format(dNow));

Part 2:

In this 2nd part of lab/homework assignment, we will enhance/modify yesterday's Lab assignment, by implementing data persistence to a Relational database. i.e. the data submitted by Contact form page should be saved into a database table, named Contacts.

To achieve this, do the following:

1. Setup a database e.g. JavaDB or MySQL or MSSQL Server or any other.

2. Implement code for a Data Access layer in your webapplication, that receives a Contact object, containing the submitted contact data and writes it into a Contacts DB table. (Hint: You may add a DBConnection class and a DBFacade class, as shown in the Data Access lecture slides)
